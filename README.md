# My Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project is developed in Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It demonstrates a machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Directory Structure
- **notebooks/** → Main Colab/Jupyter notebooks
- **src/** → Python scripts for training, evaluation, and utilities
- **requirements.txt** → List of dependencies
- **.gitignore** → Ignore unnecessary files
- **README.md** → Project documentation

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyMLProject.git
   cd MyMLProject
   ```

2. Create & activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/main_notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Notes
- Large datasets should not be uploaded. Link them in the README instead.
- You can add `.py` scripts in `src/` to automate training & evaluation.
